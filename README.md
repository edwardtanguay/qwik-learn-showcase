# qwik-learn-showcase

This is a showcase site that I am creating while taking a course on the Qwik framework. I found the framework quite buggy, QwikCity wouldn't install on Windows ("too many files" error), I got it to run on Ubuntu, but after publishing it at Vercel, is showed a 404. The only change I made to the base QwikCity site here is to add a small page called "Contacts".

- repo: https://github.com/edwardtanguay/qwik-learn-showcase
- live: https://qwik-learn-showcase.vercel.app (shows a 404)
